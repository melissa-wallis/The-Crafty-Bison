# The Crafty Bison
The Crafty Bison is a full CRUD React application I built for my front-end capstone at Nashville Software School. It was built as a portfolio to display creative projects I have made over the years.

## Overview
Crafty Bison users have the ability to create a profile as a store owner or customer. All users can view and sort items by type and view each item for further details. "Employees" have the added ability to edit, delete and add new items to the store.
